# Fusing Item Similarity Models with Self-Attention Networks

> This is a self-implemented repository for the paper **[FISSA: Fusing Item Similarity Models with Self-Attention Networks for Sequential Recommendation](http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/panwk/publications/Conference-RecSys-20-FISSA.pdf)**.

**Requirements**

```
Python                    3.8.13
NumPy                     1.23.1
PyTorch                   1.10.2
```

The code runs well with these requirements. While the code is simple, I believe it will also run well with some higher or lower versions of these packages.

**Usage**

Usage is simple, just run:

```
python entry.py
```

then everything goes well.
